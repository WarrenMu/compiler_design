## Loops

Your programming language supports loops to iterate over collections of data or repeat code execution based on certain conditions.

Example:

```language
while (condition) {
    // Code to execute repeatedly while the condition is true
}

for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // Code to execute repeatedly as long as the condition is true
}
